# Engine asks from Tiamat Default UI

From the `tiamat_default_ui` mod (repo `Tiamat_Default_Inventory`, beside the
engine). Kept in two places with the same text: in the engine repo as
`docs/engine-asks/tiamat_default_ui.md`, where the engine agent reads every
mod's asks, and in the mod's repo as `docs/engine-asks.md`, so they are on
GitHub with the mod. Change both together.

What the inventory has needed from the engine, found by building it. Each entry
says what was seen, why the mod cannot fix it, and the smallest engine change
that would. Newest first. Items are removed when they land.

## Watched, not asked: Life's status tray and narrow windows (2026-09-18)

Life draws a status tray in the bottom-right corner: a 150-pixel weather
shield with effect names stacked above it, up to about 360 pixels high on the
1080-tall HUD canvas at its fullest. It is deliberately outside Life's
`reserve` (216), which only covers the centre, where sheets are.

Run through the client's `panel::size_clear_of` with the 216 reserve, a sheet
clears the tray by 170 to 270 pixels on 16:9 and 16:10 windows and by about 20
on 4:3 (less the few pixels the theme frame is drawn outside the window). It
reaches the tray only on a window narrower than about 1.28:1: by 14 pixels on
a 5:4 monitor, and more on a window dragged tall and thin, and then only while
the tray is at its fullest.

Not an ask yet. If it matters, the engine-side fix is a reserve that is a
rectangle rather than a bottom band (a HUD saying "keep clear of the bottom
right, 150 by 360"), with sheets narrowing before they overlap it. The mod
cannot move a sheet itself.

## 17. Which click pressed a button (2026-09-29)

The crafter makes a shape from the material row a player clicks: click for
ten, right-click for one, double-click to fill a stack, as a chest works in
the game this is modelled on. It is the difference between a screen of rows
and a screen of rows plus a count picker and two craft buttons.

The mod cannot tell the clicks apart: `"pressed"` carries only `name`. The
client's button already has egui's response, which knows
`secondary_clicked` and `double_clicked`; only the event drops it. (An
`item_slot` reports `click`, but the server moves stacks on it before the
mod hears, so a slot cannot stand in for a button.)

Smallest change: `click` on `"pressed"`: `"left"`, `"right"`, or `"double"`
for the second press of a double-click in place of a second `"left"`, since
egui reports the first half as a click of its own. A right-click on a button
presses it (today it does nothing). A mod that ignores `click` sees exactly
what it sees now. `tab_shapes.lua` already reads `event.click`, treating nil
as a left click, so the crafter works as designed the day this lands and the
native check can then drive all three.

## 16. The shape editor draws a black cube (2026-09-28)

Reported from the window: with a material chosen, the Crafting tab's shape
editor is a solid black block, or a black void, instead of the material's
cells. Nothing the mod sends explains it. The tree carries
`{ type = "shape_editor", shape = game.OCCUPANCY_FULL, material = <the
numeric id game.inventory reported> }`, and the native check asserts both
reach `Widget::ShapeEditor` through the engine's own parser and checker.

On the client, `paint_shape_editor` -> `Icons::paint_cells` ->
`paint_cell_face`, which, when the atlas is registered with egui
(`register_atlas`, `register_native_texture` on `atlas_view`), draws a mesh
sampling that view with a white vertex tint scaled per face. A black cube
means that sample answers black: the wrong texture, a view egui cannot
sample as it expects, or UVs off the tile. A void means no cells at all.
Worth a look: whether an inventory slot's picture, which goes through the
same `Icons`, is right in the same window; if it is, the difference is the
editor's own path.

The mod cannot work around it: the cells are the client's to draw, and the
shape editor is the only widget that shows a cut being carved. Smallest
change: find why the atlas sample is black in the editor, and add a
render test that draws a shape editor with a real atlas and checks the
pixels are not black, since every earlier test took the no-atlas branch.

Landed so far, asserted by the native check except 11 and 12,
which are the client's own drawing:

- **15**, a tooltip on any dialog node (engine 2655837, protocol v77, drawn
  in 663bb70): `tooltip` is among the fields `screen.lua` copies from another
  mod's tree, and `widgets.tip(widget, text)` answers a copy of any widget
  with one, because a widget the builders hand back reaches its caller
  read-only. Asked for Progress's U5; the native check carries one through.
- **14**, a fixed size for `player:main` (engine 896fb30): `init.lua` calls
  `game.set_main_slots(28)`, so a full pack refuses a pickup rather than
  hiding it in slot 29. `game.give` now answers what did not fit, and the
  crafter takes back any part of a stack that fitted before it refunds the
  material, so a full pack can neither lose units nor make them; the native
  check drives that path.

- **13**, `conflicts` in `mod.toml` (engine 57e5d6f), and the engine's mods
  made secondary the same day: a mod that replaces another names it. Against
  an ordinary mod the set is refused, naming both and the way out; against
  one of the engine's reference mods — every `game/core_*` manifest now
  carries `reference = true` — the fixture stands aside and the replacement
  loads alone, so `--check-mods game` and a local game with no
  `enabled_mods` both work with `core_ui` present, and the check says which
  stood aside for which. Reference mods also load first, lose any lowest-id
  tie, and sit folded away under "Engine reference mods" on the start
  screen. Through `provides` aliases too. The manifest declares
  `conflicts = ["core_ui"]`, and the native check runs the engine's resolver
  on it beside the real `core_ui`.

- **12**, descriptions a size down (engine 990bf8a): the start screen's
  secondary lines are `TextStyle::Small`, 85% of body, and a theme changes
  faces but never sizes.

- **9**, a theme's second face (engine 86dcbb9): `[theme] text_font` is
  Spectral, on chat, text fields and prose, and `font` keeps Cinzel on
  headings and buttons. Its other half is 12.
- **10**, a themed sheet's contents clear its frame (86dcbb9): not as asked.
  The engine draws every frame `FRAME_BORDER` (18) points deep whatever the
  art's resolution, and insets the contents by the same, so each dimension of
  the room is 24 smaller. `frame_padding` went from 24 to 8, so the screens
  have more room than before, and the native check and preview use the new
  margin.
- **11**, a faint outline on resting widgets and a text field a shade above the
  sheet (86dcbb9).

- **5**, a container measures a child by the `size` it asked for (engine
  26b87d8), and **6**, a screen claims its height once and no longer scrolls
  in a sheet built to hold it (8d83855). The same class of bug, the interface
  measuring something twice and disagreeing with itself. `section` no longer
  sums its children's sizes itself; the README's wardrobe tab fits on the
  engine's own measuring.
- **7**, a HUD reserves the bottom of the screen (b3d237c): `hud.lua` is
  registered with `reserve = 138`, and sheets rise to clear the tallest reserve
  any mod declares.
- **8**, a mod's look for the engine's own screens (88c42c9, 0c33026):
  `[theme]` in `mod.toml` dresses the pause, settings and start screens and
  every sheet, the inventory's included, so the tree no longer draws a frame
  of its own.

- **1**, a table handed back to its owner iterates, and **2**, a disabled
  mod's functions stop — engine 823aac3.
- **4**, a picture a HUD script draws is fetched, and **0**, a mod can ask for
  a content hash — engine 6aae28c, protocol v61. `game.register_picture` puts
  the hotbar's slot frame in the table every client fetches on join and answers
  its hash, which `hotbar.lua` sends to the script with `game.set_hud`;
  `game.content_hash` gives the dialog frames theirs. No hash is written by
  hand anywhere in this mod.
